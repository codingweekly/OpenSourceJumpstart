# Open Source Jumpstart
Welcome to OpenSourceJumpstart, a beginner-friendly repository designed to help aspiring developers get started with contributing to open source projects. 
Whether you're new to programming or looking to expand your skills, this repository aims to guide you through the process of becoming an open source contributor.

Generally Open Source Contribution consists of identifying an project you would like to contribute to and following the steps below. I have created this project/repository to allow you to get hands on experience. 

## Tools to Use
You can use any of the following tools:
- Github.com web interface 
- Git command line
- Github CLI

Check out https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git for more details

Once you have choosen your tools and set them up please follow the steps highlighted below to contribute to this project:

## Fork this repository
Forking the repository means creating your own copy of the project on GitHub. By forking, you will have your independent version of the project that you can freely modify and experiment with. Forking is the first step to contributing to an open source project.

Click on the "Fork" button on the GitHub repository page.

## Clone this repository
Cloning the repository involves creating a local copy of the project on your computer. You can use Git commands or a Git client to clone the repository. Cloning enables you to work on the project's code and make changes locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

## Create a branch
Before making any changes to the code, create a new branch. Branches provide a way to isolate your changes from the main codebase, allowing you to work on a specific feature or bug fix independently. Create a descriptive branch name that reflects the purpose of your changes.

```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

## Make your changes
Once you have created a branch, start making your desired changes to the codebase. This can include fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or optimizing existing code. Follow the project's guidelines and coding conventions to ensure consistency with the existing codebase.

## Commit your changes
Committing is the process of saving your changes locally with a descriptive message. Make atomic commits, which means each commit should contain a single logical change. Clearly describe the purpose and scope of your changes in the commit message to aid understanding for other contributors and maintainers.

```
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## Push your changes to GitHub
After committing your changes locally, push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub. This action syncs your local changes with your remote repository on GitHub, making it accessible to others. Other developers can now see your changes and review them.

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

## Submit a pull request
A pull request (PR) is the formal way of proposing your changes to the original repository for review and potential inclusion. It allows you to compare and merge your branch into the main project. Submitting a PR initiates a discussion with the project maintainers and other contributors, who can provide feedback, suggestions, or request changes before merging your code.

After pushing your branch to your forked repository, go to the original repository's GitHub page and click on "New pull request".

## Next Steps
After submitting a pull request, the project maintainers will review your changes. Be responsive to their feedback and address any requested changes or improvements. Engage in discussions around your contribution, answering questions and addressing concerns. Once your changes meet the project's standards and requirements, they will be merged into the main codebase. Congratulations on successfully contributing to the project!

Next steps may include exploring other issues or features to work on, continuing to improve the project, or exploring other open source projects to contribute to. You can also encourage others to get involved in open source and share your experiences to inspire more developers to contribute.

By following these steps, developers can gain practical experience in contributing to open source projects, familiarize themselves with collaboration workflows, and build their reputation in the open source community.
